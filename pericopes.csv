4686,ROM,3,28,30,"but all, without difference, by faith, only;"
4687,ROM,3,31.,31,and yet the law is not abolished.
4688,ROM,4,1,9,Abraham's faith was imputed to him for righteousness;
4689,ROM,4,10,12,before he was circumcised.
4690,ROM,4,13,15,By faith only he and his seed received the promise.
4691,ROM,4,16,23,Abraham is the father of all that believe.
4692,ROM,4,24,25,Our faith also shall be imputed to us for righteousness.
4693,ROM,5,1.,1,"Being justified by faith, we have peace with God;"
4694,ROM,5,2,7,and joy in our hope;
4695,ROM,5,8,9,"that since we were reconciled by his blood, when we were enemies;"
4696,ROM,5,10,11,"we shall much more be saved, being reconciled."
4697,ROM,5,12,16,As sin and death came by Adam;
4698,ROM,5,17,19,so much more righteousness and life by Jesus Christ.
4699,ROM,5,20,21,"Where sin abounded, grace did superabound."
4700,ROM,6,1.,1,We may not live in sin;
4701,ROM,6,2.,2,for we are dead unto it;
4702,ROM,6,3,11,as appears by our baptism.
4703,ROM,6,12,17,Let not sin reign any more;
4704,ROM,6,18,22,because we have yielded ourselves to the service of righteousness;
4705,ROM,6,23.,23,and for that death is the wages of sin.
4706,ROM,7,1,3,No law hath power over a man longer than he lives.
4707,ROM,7,4,6,But we are dead to the law.
4708,ROM,7,7,11,Yet is not the law sin;
4709,ROM,7,12,15,"but holy, just and good;"
4710,ROM,7,16,25,"as I acknowledge, who am grieved because I cannot keep it."
4711,ROM,8,1,4,"They that are in Christ, are free from condemnation."
4712,ROM,8,5,12,What harm comes of the flesh;
4713,ROM,8,13,18,and what good of the Spirit.
4714,ROM,8,19,28,"The glorious deliverance all things long for,"
4715,ROM,8,29,37,was beforehand decreed from God.
4716,ROM,8,38,39,Nothing can sever us from his love.
4717,ROM,9,1,6,Paul is sorry for the Jews.
4718,ROM,9,7,17,All of Abraham not of the promise.
4719,ROM,9,18,24,God's sovereignty.
4720,ROM,9,25,31,"The calling of the Gentiles and rejecting of the Jews, foretold."
4721,ROM,9,32,33,The cause of the Jews' stumbling.
4722,ROM,10,1,10,"The Scripture shows the difference between the righteousness of the law, and that of faith;"
4723,ROM,10,11,17,"and that all, both Jew and Gentile, that believe, shall not be confounded;"
4724,ROM,10,18.,18,and that the Gentiles shall receive the word and believe.
4725,ROM,10,19,21,Israel was not ignorant of these things.
4726,ROM,11,1,6,God has not cast off all Israel.
4727,ROM,11,7,15,"Some were elected, though the rest were hardened."
4728,ROM,11,16,17,There is hope of their conversion.
4729,ROM,11,18,25,The Gentiles may not exult over them;
4730,ROM,11,26,32,for there is a promise of their salvation.
4731,ROM,11,33,36,God's judgments are unsearchable.
4732,ROM,12,1,2,God's mercies must move us to please God.
4733,ROM,12,3,5,No man must think too well of himself;
4734,ROM,12,6,8,but everyone attend on that calling wherein he is placed.
4735,ROM,12,9,18,"Love, and many other duties are required of us."
4736,ROM,12,19,21,Revenge is especially forbidden.
4737,ROM,13,1,7,"Subjection, and many other duties, we owe to the magistrates."
4738,ROM,13,8,10,Love is the fulfilling of the law.
4739,ROM,13,11,14,"Gluttony and drunkenness, and the works of darkness, are out of season in the time of the Gospel."
4740,ROM,14,1,12,Men may not contemn nor condemn one another for things indifferent;
4741,ROM,14,13,14,but take heed that they give no offence in them;
4742,ROM,14,15,23,which the apostle proves unlawful by many reasons.
4743,ROM,15,1.,1,The strong must bear with the weak.
4744,ROM,15,2.,2,We must not please ourselves;
4745,ROM,15,3,6,for Christ did not so;
4746,ROM,15,7.,7,"but receive one another, as Christ did us all;"
4747,ROM,15,8,14,both Jews and Gentiles;
4748,ROM,15,15,27,Paul excuses his writing;
4749,ROM,15,28,29,and promises to see them;
4750,ROM,15,30,33,and requests their prayers.
4751,ROM,16,1,16,Paul wills the brethren to greet many;
4752,ROM,16,17,20,and advises them to take heed of those which cause dissension and offences;
4753,ROM,16,21,27,and after sundry salutations ends with praise and thanks to God.
4754,1CO,1,1,9,"After his salutation and thanksgiving,"
4755,1CO,1,10,11,"he exhorts them to unity,"
4756,1CO,1,12,17,and reproves their dissensions.
4757,1CO,1,18,20,"God destroys the wisdom of the wise,"
4758,1CO,1,21,25,by the foolishness of preaching;
4759,1CO,1,26,27,"and calls not the wise, mighty, and noble,"
4760,1CO,1,28,31,"but the foolish, weak, and men of no account."
4761,1CO,2,1,5,"He declares that his preaching, though it bring not excellency of speech, or of human wisdom, yet consists in the power of God;"
4762,1CO,2,6,16,"and so far excels the wisdom of this world, and human sense, that the natural man cannot understand it."
4763,1CO,3,1,2,Milk is fit for children.
4764,1CO,3,3,6,"Strife and division, arguments of a fleshly mind."
4765,1CO,3,7,8,"He that planteth and he that watereth, are nothing."
4766,1CO,3,9,10,The ministers are God's fellow-workmen.
4767,1CO,3,11,15,Christ the only foundation.
4768,1CO,3,16,18,"Men the temples of God, which must be kept holy."
4769,1CO,3,19,23,The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.
4770,1CO,4,1,6,In what account the ministers ought to be had.
4771,1CO,4,7,8,We have nothing which we have not received.
4772,1CO,4,9,12,"The apostles spectacles to the world, angels, and men;"
4773,1CO,4,13,14,the filth and offscouring of the world;
4774,1CO,4,15.,15,yet our fathers in Christ;
4775,1CO,4,16,21,whom we ought to follow.
4776,1CO,5,1,5,"The incestuous person,"
4777,1CO,5,6.,6,is cause rather of shame unto them than of rejoicing.
4778,1CO,5,7,9,The old leaven is to be purged out.
4779,1CO,5,10,13,Hienous offenders are to be shamed and avoided.
4780,1CO,6,1,5,"The Corinthians must not vex their brethren, in going to law with them;"
4781,1CO,6,6,8,especially under infidels.
4782,1CO,6,9,14,The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
4783,1CO,6,15,20,"Our bodies are the members of Christ, and temples of the Holy Ghost: they must not therefore be defiled."
4784,1CO,7,1,3,He treats of marriage;
4785,1CO,7,4,9,"shewing it to be a remedy against fornication,"
4786,1CO,7,10,19,and that the bond thereof ought not lightly to be dissolved.
4787,1CO,7,20,24,Every man must be content with his vocation.
4788,1CO,7,25,34,Virginity wherefore to be embraced;
4789,1CO,7,35,40,"and for what respects we may either marry, or abstain from marrying."
4790,1CO,8,1,7,To abstain from meats offered to idols.
4791,1CO,8,8,10,"We must not abuse our Christian liberty, to the offence of our brethren;"
4792,1CO,8,11,13,but must bridle our knowledge with charity.
4793,1CO,9,1,6,He shows his liberty;
4794,1CO,9,7,14,and that the minister ought to live by the Gospel;
4795,1CO,9,15,17,"yet that himself has of his own accord abstained,"
4796,1CO,9,18,21,"to be either chargeable unto them,"
4797,1CO,9,22,23,"or offensive unto any, in matters indifferent."
4798,1CO,9,24,27,Our life is like unto a race.
4799,1CO,10,1,6,The sacraments of the Jews are types of ours;
4800,1CO,10,7,10,"and their punishments,"
4801,1CO,10,11,12,examples for us.
4802,1CO,10,13,20,We must flee from idolatry.
4803,1CO,10,21,23,We must not make the Lord's table the table of devils;
4804,1CO,10,24,33,and in things indifferent we must have regard of our brethren.
4805,1CO,11,1,3,"He reproves them, because in holy assemblies,"
4806,1CO,11,4,5,"their men prayed with their heads covered,"
4807,1CO,11,6,16,and women with their heads uncovered;
4808,1CO,11,17,20,"and because generally their meetings were not for the better, but for the worse;"
4809,1CO,11,21,24,"as, namely, in profaning with their own feast the Lord's supper."
4810,1CO,11,25,34,"Lastly, he calls them to the first institution thereof."
4811,1CO,12,1,3,"Spiritual gifts,"
4812,1CO,12,4,6,"are diverse,"
4813,1CO,12,7.,7,yet all to profit withal.
4814,1CO,12,8,11,And to that end are diversely bestowed;
4815,1CO,12,12,21,"that by the like proportion, as the members of a natural body tend all to the mutual decency,"
4816,1CO,12,22,25,"service,"
4817,1CO,12,26.,26,and succour of the same body;
4818,1CO,12,27,31,"so we should do for one another, to make up the mystical body of Christ."
4819,1CO,13,1,2,"All gifts,"
4820,1CO,13,3.,3,"how excellent soever, are nothing worth without charity."
4821,1CO,13,4,12,"The praises thereof,"
4822,1CO,13,13.,13,and prelation before hope and faith.
4823,1CO,14,1.,1,"Prophecy is commended,"
4824,1CO,14,2,5,"and preferred before speaking with tongues,"
4825,1CO,14,6,11,by a comparison drawn from musical instruments.
4826,1CO,14,12,21,"Both must be referred to edification,"
4827,1CO,14,22,25,as to their true and proper end.
4828,1CO,14,26.,26,"The true use of each is taught,"
4829,1CO,14,27,33,and the abuse taxed.
4830,1CO,14,34,40,Women are forbidden to speak in church.
4831,1CO,15,1,11,"By Christ's resurrection,"
4832,1CO,15,12,20,"he proves the necessity of our resurrection, against all such as deny the resurrection of the body."
4833,1CO,15,21,34,"The fruit,"
4834,1CO,15,35,50,and the manner thereof;
4835,1CO,15,51,58,and of the changing of them that shall be found alive at the last day.
4836,1CO,16,1,9,He exhorts them to relieve the want of the brethren at Jerusalem.
4837,1CO,16,10,12,Commends Timothy;
4838,1CO,16,13,15,"and after friendly admonitions,"
4839,1CO,16,16,24,concludes his epistle with divers salutations.
4840,2CO,1,1,2,Paul salutes the Corinthians;
4841,2CO,1,3,7,"he encourages them against troubles, by the comforts and deliverances which God had given him, as in all his afflictions,"
4842,2CO,1,8,11,so particularly in his late danger in Asia.
4843,2CO,1,12,14,"And calling both his own conscience and theirs to witness of his sincere manner of preaching the immutable truth of the gospel,"
4844,2CO,1,15,24,"he excuses his not coming to them, as proceeding not of lightness, but of his lenity towards them."
4845,2CO,2,1,5,"Having shown the reason why he came not to them,"
4846,2CO,2,6,9,"he requires them to forgive and to comfort that excommunicated person,"
4847,2CO,2,10,11,even as himself also upon his true repentance had forgiven him;
4848,2CO,2,12,13,"declaring withal why he departed from Troas to Macedonia,"
4849,2CO,2,14,17,and the happy success which God gave to his preaching in all places.
4850,2CO,3,1,5,"Lest their false teachers should charge him with vain glory, he shows the faith and graces of the Corinthians to be a sufficient commendation of his ministry."
4851,2CO,3,6,11,"Whereupon entering a comparison between the ministers of the law and of the gospel,"
4852,2CO,3,12,18,"he proves that his ministry is so far the more excellent, as the gospel of life and liberty is more glorious than the law of condemnation."
4853,2CO,4,1,6,"He declares how he has used all sincerity and faithful diligence in preaching the gospel,"
4854,2CO,4,7,11,"and how the troubles and persecutions which he daily endured for the same did redound to the praise of God's power,"
4855,2CO,4,12,15,"to the benefit of the church,"
4856,2CO,4,16,18,and to the apostle's own eternal glory.
4857,2CO,5,1,8,"That in his assured hope of immortal glory,"
4858,2CO,5,9,11,"and in expectation of it, and of the general judgment, he labours to keep a good conscience;"
4859,2CO,5,12,13,"not that he may herein boast of himself,"
4860,2CO,5,14,17,"but as one that, having received life from Christ, endeavours to live as a new creature to Christ only,"
4861,2CO,5,18,21,"and by his ministry of reconciliation, to reconcile others also in Christ to God."
4862,2CO,6,1,2,"That he has approved himself a faithful minister of Christ by his exhortations,"
4863,2CO,6,3.,3,"and by integrity of life,"
4864,2CO,6,4,9,and by patient enduring all kinds of affliction and disgrace for the gospel.
4865,2CO,6,10,12,"Of which he speaks the more boldly amongst them because his heart is open to them,"
4866,2CO,6,13.,13,and he expects the like affection from them again;
4867,2CO,6,14,18,"exhorting them to flee the society and pollutions of idolaters, as being themselves temples of the living God."
4868,2CO,7,1.,1,He proceeds in exhorting them to purity of life;
4869,2CO,7,2.,2,and to bear him like affection as he does to them.
4870,2CO,7,3,12,"Whereof lest he might seem to doubt, he declares what comfort he took in his afflictions by the report which Titus gave of their godly sorrow, which his former epistle had wrought in them;"
4871,2CO,7,13,16,"and of their loving-kindness and obedience toward Titus, answerable to his former boastings of them."
4872,2CO,8,1,6,"He stirs them up to a liberal contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem, by the example of the Macedonians;"
4873,2CO,8,7,8,by commendation of their former forwardness;
4874,2CO,8,9,13,by the example of Christ;
4875,2CO,8,14,15,and by the spiritual profit that shall redound to themselves thereby;
4876,2CO,8,16,24,"commending to them the integrity and willingness of Titus, and those other brethren, who upon his request, exhortation, and commendation, were purposely come to them for this business."
4877,2CO,9,1,5,"He yields the reason why, though he knew their forwardness, yet he sent Titus and his brethren beforehand."
4878,2CO,9,6,9,"And he proceeds in stirring them up to a bountiful alms, as being but a kind of sowing of seed,"
4879,2CO,9,10,12,"which shall return a great increase to them,"
4880,2CO,9,13,15,and occasion a great sacrifice of thanksgivings unto God.
4881,2CO,10,1,6,"Against the false apostles, who disgraced the weakness of his person and bodily presence, he shows the spiritual might and authority with which he was armed against all adverse powers;"
4882,2CO,10,7,11,"assuring them that at his coming he will be found as mighty in word as he is now in writing, being absent;"
4883,2CO,10,12,18,"and withal taxing them for reaching out themselves beyond their compass, and vaunting themselves of other men's labours."
4884,2CO,11,1,4,"Out of his jealousy over the Corinthians, who seemed to make more account of the false apostles than of him, he enters into a forced commendation of himself,"
4885,2CO,11,5,6,"of his equality with the chief apostles,"
4886,2CO,11,7,12,"of his preaching the gospel to them freely, and without any charge to them;"
4887,2CO,11,13,22,shewing that he was not inferior to those deceitful workers in any legal prerogative;
4888,2CO,11,23,33,"and in the service of Christ, and in all kinds of sufferings for his ministry, far superior."
4889,2CO,12,1,8,"For commending of his apostleship, though he might glory of his wonderful revelations,"
4890,2CO,12,9,10,yet he rather chooses to glory of his infirmities;
4891,2CO,12,11,13,blaming them for forcing him to this vain boasting.
4892,2CO,12,14,19,He promises to come to them again; but yet altogether in the affection of a father;
4893,2CO,12,20,21,"although he fears he shall to his grief find many offenders, and public disorders there."
4894,2CO,13,1,4,"He threatens severity, and the power of his apostleship, against obstinate sinners."
4895,2CO,13,5,6,"And, advising them to a trial of their faith,"
4896,2CO,13,7,10,"and to a reformation of their sins before his coming,"
4897,2CO,13,11,14,he concludes his epistle with a general exhortation and a prayer.
4898,GAL,1,1,7,He wonders that they have so soon left him and the gospel;
4899,GAL,1,8,10,and accurses those that preach any other gospel than he did.
4900,GAL,1,11,13,"He learned the gospel not of men, but of God;"
4901,GAL,1,14,16,and shows what he was before his calling;
4902,GAL,1,17,24,and what he did immediately after it.
4903,GAL,2,1,2,"He shows when he went up again to Jerusalem, and for what purpose;"
4904,GAL,2,3,10,and that Titus was not circumcised;
4905,GAL,2,11,13,"and that he resisted Peter, and told him the reason;"
4906,GAL,2,14,19,"why he and others, being Jews, do believe in Christ to be justified by faith, and not by works;"
4907,GAL,2,20,21,"and that they live not in sin, who are so justified."
4908,GAL,3,1,5,"He asks what moved them to leave the faith, and hang upon the law."
4909,GAL,3,6,8,"They that believe are justified,"
4910,GAL,3,9.,9,and blessed with Abraham.
4911,GAL,3,10,29,And this he shows by many reasons.
4912,GAL,4,1,4,"We were under the law till Christ came, as the heir is under the guardian till he be of age."
4913,GAL,4,5,6,But Christ freed us from the law;
4914,GAL,4,7,13,therefore we are servants no longer to it.
4915,GAL,4,14,21,"He remembers their good will to him, and his to them;"
4916,GAL,4,22,31,and shows that we are the sons of Abraham by the freewoman.
4917,GAL,5,1,2,"He wills them to stand in their liberty,"
4918,GAL,5,3,12,and not to observe circumcision;
4919,GAL,5,13,18,"but rather love, which is the sum of the law."
4920,GAL,5,19,21,"He reckons up the works of the flesh,"
4921,GAL,5,22,24,"and the fruits of the Spirit,"
4922,GAL,5,25,26,and exhorts to walk in the Spirit.
4923,GAL,6,1.,1,"He moves them to deal mildly with a brother that has slipped,"
4924,GAL,6,2,5,and to bear one another's burden;
4925,GAL,6,6,8,"to be liberal to their teachers,"
4926,GAL,6,9,11,and not weary of well-doing.
4927,GAL,6,12,13,He shows what they intend that preach circumcision.
4928,GAL,6,14,18,"He glories in nothing, save in the cross of Christ."
4929,EPH,1,1,2,"After the salutation,"
4930,EPH,1,3.,3,"and thanksgiving for the Ephesians,"
4931,EPH,1,4,5,"he treats of our election,"
4932,EPH,1,6,10,and adoption by grace;
4933,EPH,1,11,12,which is the true and proper fountain of man's salvation.
4934,EPH,1,13,15,"And because the height of this mystery cannot be easily attained unto,"
4935,EPH,1,16,23,he prays that they may come to the full knowledge and possession thereof in Christ.
4936,EPH,2,1,9,"By comparing what we were by nature, with what we are by grace,"
4937,EPH,2,10,22,"he declares that we are made for good works: and being brought near by Christ, should not live as Gentiles and foreigners, as in time past, but as citizens with the saints, and the family of God."
4938,EPH,3,1,7,The hidden mystery that the Gentiles should be saved was made known to Paul by revelation;
4939,EPH,3,8,12,"and to him was that grace given, that he should preach it."
4940,EPH,3,13.,13,He desires them not to faint for his tribulation;
4941,EPH,3,14,21,and prays that they may perceive the great love of Christ toward them.
4942,EPH,4,1,6,He exhorts to unity;
4943,EPH,4,7,10,and declares that God therefore gives divers gifts unto men;
4944,EPH,4,11,15,"that his church might be edified,"
4945,EPH,4,16,17,and grow up in Christ.
4946,EPH,4,18,23,He calls them from the impurity of the Gentiles;
4947,EPH,4,24.,24,to put on the new man;
4948,EPH,4,25,28,to cast off lying;
4949,EPH,4,29,32,and corrupt communication.
4950,EPH,5,1,2,After general exhortations to love;
4951,EPH,5,3.,3,to flee fornication;
4952,EPH,5,4,6,and all uncleanness;
4953,EPH,5,7,14,not to converse with the wicked;
4954,EPH,5,15,17,to walk warily;
4955,EPH,5,18,21,and to be filled with the Spirit;
4956,EPH,5,22,24,"he descends to the particular duties, how wives ought to obey their husbands;"
4957,EPH,5,25,31,"and husbands ought to love their wives,"
4958,EPH,5,32,33,even as Christ does his church.
4959,EPH,6,1,4,The duty of children towards their parents;
4960,EPH,6,5,9,of servants towards their masters.
